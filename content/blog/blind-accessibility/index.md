description: "Screen readers such as TalkBack enable PVIs(people with visual impairments) to navigate smartphone UI(user interfaces) through sequential focus movement. However, because these auditory UI impose a linear navigation structure, they often fail to reflect user intentions, leading to inefficiencies and unnecessary cognitive load. This project examined how PVIs actually explore and interact with smartphone UIs, with the aim of identifying structural mismatches between system-provided focus sequences and user goals. To collect real-world usage data, we modified the open-source version of TalkBack so that it operated identically to the original while logging interaction events in detail. With this tool, we recruited 11 participants with visual impairments and gathered one month of smartphone usage logs, after which we conducted semi-structured interviews. Analyses revealed three recurring inefficiency patterns: unintentionally skipping initial focus targets, traversing non-interactable UI elements, and reversing navigation directions. Building on these findings, we developed algorithms to detect such patterns automatically in usage logs, providing a foundation for designing accessibility services that reduce temporal and cognitive costs for screen reader users."
