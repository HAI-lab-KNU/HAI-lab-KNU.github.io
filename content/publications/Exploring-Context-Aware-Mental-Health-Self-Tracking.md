  People with mental health issues often remain indoors, limiting their outdoor activities. This emphasizes the importance of in-home self-tracking technologies to gain insights into mental health conditions. This study introduces a proactive self-tracking system using multimodal smart speakers that deliver mental health surveys through the experience sampling method (ESM). The system detects context transitions to determine optimal delivery moments and allows users to respond via voice or touch. A four-week field study with 20 participants showed that context-aware ESM delivery improved compliance. Participants preferred touch over voice interaction, and the modality preference varied by context.
