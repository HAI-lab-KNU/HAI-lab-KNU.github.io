# Developing and Evaluating Low-Cost Level 3 Vehicle Simulator

## Abstract

Conditional autonomous vehicles are becoming popular. As autonomous driving technology advances, drivers can spend more time on secondary tasks rather than driving, and accordingly, in-vehicle services for driver convenience will become more diverse. However, paradoxically, services for driver convenience can increase the accident risk of conditional autonomous vehicles. During autonomous driving, drivers must immediately transfer control (manual driving) when situations occur that the system cannot control, because attention distraction from secondary tasks slows response time. This makes it difficult to ensure driver safety. Therefore, research analyzing the negative effects of such services on drivers should be conducted first. To promote related research, this paper developed a simulator that can simulate autonomous vehicles at low cost, and conducted feasibility and usability tests to determine whether it can be used in actual research.

## Research Motivation

With the popularization of conditional autonomous vehicles, automobiles are changing from a space for transportation to a space that provides convenience. The number of autonomous vehicles is expected to reach approximately 60 million by 2028, and accordingly, it is expected that most vehicles in the near future will have conditional autonomous driving mode applied. Automobile companies such as Tesla have been applying low-level autonomous driving technology to automobiles since 2015, and with the popularization of such conditional autonomous vehicles, the burden of driving is decreasing.

The International Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) classifies autonomous vehicles into a total of 6 levels from 'Level 0' to 'Level 5', which is the fully autonomous stage. Level 0 has no driving assistance functions. The current level of commercialized autonomous vehicles is Level 2. Up to Level 2, the system assists driving, but from Level 3, the system performs driving so that the vehicle can change lanes, overtake the car in front, or avoid obstacles on its own. However, up to Level 4, autonomous driving technology has limitations and performs conditional autonomous driving. That is, when unexpected situations occur, the system may not respond appropriately. At this time, drivers must receive driving control from the system (takeover) and perform manual driving.
