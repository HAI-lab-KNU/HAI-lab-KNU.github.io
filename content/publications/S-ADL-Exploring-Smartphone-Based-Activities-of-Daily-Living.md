  Accurate detection of blood alcohol concentration (BAC) is vital for public safety and health. Prior methods mainly focused on computer-based or neuropsychological tests, yet the potential of daily smartphone interactions remains underexplored. This study introduces the concept of Smartphone-based Activities of Daily Living (S-ADL), inspired by Instrumental ADL (I-ADL), to detect BAC. A controlled laboratory experiment with 40 young adults assessed the feasibility of using S-ADLs—such as SMS response delay, web search behavior, and financial task handling—as indicators of BAC levels. The study demonstrates that S-ADL metrics significantly correlate with BAC, offering a promising direction for non-invasive, real-world alcohol monitoring using smartphones.
