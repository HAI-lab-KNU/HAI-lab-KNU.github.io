# Interruptibility for in-vehicle multitasking: influence of voice task demands and adaptive behaviors

## Abstract

As a countermeasure to visual-manual distractions, auditory-verbal (voice) interfaces are becoming increasingly popular for in-vehicle systems. This opens up new opportunities for drivers to receive proactive personalized services from various service domains.

However, prior studies warned that such interactions can cause cognitive distractions due to the nature of concurrent multitasking with a limited amount of cognitive resources.

## Research Objectives

In this study, we examined:

1. **Task Demand Impact**: How the varying demands of proactive voice tasks under diverse driving situations impact driver interruptibility
2. **Adaptive Behavior Analysis**: How drivers adapt their concurrent multitasking of driving and proactive voice tasks, and how the adaptive behaviors are related to driver interruptibility

## Research Methodology

Our quantitative and qualitative analyses showed that in addition to the driving-task demand, the voice-task demand and adaptive behaviors are also significantly related to driver interruptibility.
