# Understanding emotion changes in mobile experience sampling

## Abstract

Mobile experience sampling methods (ESMs) are widely used to measure users' affective states by randomly sending self-report requests. However, this random probing can interrupt users and adversely influence users' emotional states by inducing disturbance and stress.

This work aims to understand how ESMs themselves may compromise the validity of ESM responses and what contextual factors contribute to changes in emotions when users respond to ESMs.

## Research Methodology

Towards this goal, we analyze 2,227 samples of the mobile ESM data collected from 78 participants. Our results show ESM interruptions positively or negatively affected users' emotional states in at least 38% of ESMs, and the changes in emotions are closely related to the contexts users were in prior to ESMs.

## Key Research Findings

### ESM Impact on Emotional States
- **Interruption Effects**: ESM interruptions affected users' emotional states in at least 38% of cases
- **Bidirectional Impact**: Both positive and negative emotional changes were observed
- **Context Dependency**: Emotional changes closely related to users' prior contexts

### Contextual Factors
- **Pre-ESM Context**: Users' emotional state before receiving ESM requests
- **Environmental Factors**: Surrounding conditions and activities
- **Temporal Factors**: Time of day and duration of activities
- **Social Context**: Presence of others and social interactions

## Research Contributions

### 1. ESM Validity Assessment
- **Measurement Accuracy**: Understanding how ESMs themselves affect responses
- **Bias Identification**: Recognition of potential measurement biases
- **Methodological Implications**: Impact on research validity

### 2. Contextual Analysis
- **Pre-interruption State**: Analysis of users' emotional state before ESM
- **Environmental Context**: Understanding surrounding conditions
- **Temporal Patterns**: Time-based variations in emotional responses

### 3. Mitigation Strategies
- **Design Considerations**: Recommendations for reducing ESM interference
- **Timing Optimization**: Optimal moments for ESM delivery
- **User Experience**: Balancing research needs with user comfort

## Dataset

- **Participants**: 78 participants
- **Data Points**: 2,227 mobile ESM samples
- **Methodology**: Experience sampling method with mobile devices
- **Analysis**: Quantitative and qualitative assessment of emotional changes

## Practical Implications

### Research Design
- **ESM Timing**: Consider optimal moments for sampling requests
- **Context Awareness**: Account for users' current emotional and environmental state
- **Bias Mitigation**: Strategies to reduce measurement interference

### User Experience
- **Minimal Disruption**: Design ESMs to minimize emotional disturbance
- **Contextual Sensitivity**: Adapt sampling based on user context
- **Stress Reduction**: Methods to reduce ESM-induced stress

## Technical Approach

### Data Collection
- **Mobile ESM**: Random self-report requests via mobile devices
- **Emotional Tracking**: Measurement of affective states before and after ESM
- **Contextual Recording**: Documentation of environmental and situational factors

### Analysis Methods
- **Statistical Analysis**: Quantitative assessment of emotional changes
- **Contextual Correlation**: Relationship between context and emotional impact
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identification of factors affecting ESM validity
