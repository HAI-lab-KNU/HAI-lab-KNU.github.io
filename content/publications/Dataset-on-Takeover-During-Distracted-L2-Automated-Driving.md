  Automated driving systems enable drivers to perform various non-driving tasks, raising safety concerns related to distraction and takeover performance. However, publicly available datasets on this topic are scarce. This study introduces TD2D, a rich dataset collected from 50 drivers using an L2 automated driving simulator, balanced in gender and age. The dataset includes 500 takeover cases across 10 conditionsâ€”spanning no task, visual, and auditory secondary tasks. It provides data on takeover performance, workload, physiological signals, and ocular measures. TD2D offers a significant contribution to advancing research in safe automated driving and intelligent driver monitoring systems.
